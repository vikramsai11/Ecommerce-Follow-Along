# Milestone 1: 

In a MERN stack application, login and sign-up (authentication) typically involve a process where users can register (sign-up) with their credentials, and later log in using those credentials. The login and sign-up process can be divided into several steps, with separate client-side (React) and server-side (Node.js/Express) handling.



# Milestone 2:
## Milestone 2: Login Page & Authentication Setup

### Description
Milestone 2 focuses on the creation and setup of the **Login Page** for the application, including basic UI elements like forms and fields for user authentication. This milestone also includes setting up Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring responsive and modern design practices. 

### Key Features Completed:
- **Login Page Design**: 
  - Created a responsive login page with email and password inputs.
  - Added "Remember Me" checkbox and "Forgot Password?" link.
  
- **Tailwind CSS Setup**: 
  - Integrated Tailwind CSS for styling the login page with a clean, modern interface.
  - Configured the `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files.

- **New Branch Creation**: 
  - Created a new branch (`milestone-2`) to manage and track the progress for this feature.
  
- **Responsive Layout**: 
  - The login page is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, adjusting for both mobile and desktop views.

### Technologies Used:
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **React Router**: For managing routing (if applicable).
- **Axios**: To handle HTTP requests for user authentication (in future milestones)



## Milestone 3: Backend Setup

### Progress:
- Set up the project folder structure with routes, controllers, models, middlewares, and utilities.
- Created a Node.js server with Express.
- Connected the server to MongoDB using Mongoose.
- Added error handling middleware for better debugging.
- 

## Milestone 4 Overview

### In this milestone, the following features were implemented:

- User Model Creation: A new User model was created to represent user data in the database, including necessary fields such as name, email, password, etc.
- Multer Integration: Multer was integrated to handle file uploads (e.g., profile images, documents, etc.). Multer handles multipart/form-data, which is used for uploading files in Node.js applications.

  - The email is valid.
  - The password meets the minimum length requirement and matches the confirm password field.
- Upon successful form submission, the user is redirected to the Login page.

Technologies used:
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router


## Milestone 6: Backend endpoint for the Signup page to store all user data securely

In this milestone, I have implemented User Authentication for the backend with the following features:
